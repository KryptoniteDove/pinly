    "description": "Pinly adds a 100% configurable numeric pin login mechanism to the DOM. Features a responsive mobile keypad friendly design that just works straight out of the box. If you're more confident you can configure a completely unique look and feel by changing the styles in the CSS file included. Pinly takes care of user interactions, use tab or key a number to cycle forward, or use backspace to correct mistakes. Entering a pin is as easy as 1..2..3..4. Pinly supports custom callback methods for processing logins and comes packaged with two custom event handlers that listen for success & fail to make integration simple.",
